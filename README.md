# BSTransparentWall
TransparentWall is made to do one simple thing
### - Make the in-game walls transparent for you! -

## Features
* Enable transparent walls in VR
* Disable the transparent walls for the LIV camera (introduced in Beat Saber v0.13.0)

These options can be changed from inside the game, so there's no need to edit configuration files

## Note
While TransparentWall is active in the HMD (in-game/VR), you will not be able to post your high scores.

Turning it off will allow you to post your scores to the leaderboards again. AND you do not need to restart the game ;)
